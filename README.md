#Arduino Smart Car Parking System
This Arduino-based project is a Smart Car Parking System designed for secure and automated vehicle entry and exit using RFID access control, IR sensors, an OLED display, a servo-controlled gate, and a buzzer for feedback. It also tracks available parking slots in real-time.

🧠 Main Features
RFID Card Verification: Only authorized users can access the parking gate.

IR Sensors: Used for detecting vehicle presence at entry and exit points.

Slot Management: Automatically increases or decreases the number of available slots.

OLED Display: Shows welcome message, parking status, and feedback like “Access Granted”, “Parking Full”, etc.

Servo Motor Gate Control: Opens and closes the gate smoothly when access is granted.

Buzzer Feedback: Audible alert for granted or denied access.

Real-time Monitoring: Vehicles must pass both entry and exit IR sensors for the system to confirm parking actions.
